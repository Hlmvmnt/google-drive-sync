![The Synchronize Command](../assets/img/enabled-cmds.png)

You might want a degree of safety when accessing the plugin menu.  The
**Sync with Drive** command is directly adjacent to the **Upload to Drive**
command, and an accidental slip of the mouse might end in a minor catastrophe.

To help avoid that hazard, you can enable the commands you use most, and 
disable those you don't.  

## What Happens
* Commands that are checked are enabled on the plugin menu; unchecked 
commands are disabled.
* Disabling the **Sync with Drive** command also disables any enabled
[auto-sync](autosync) options.

## How it Works
* Click **Configuration** on the plugin menu to open the dialog shown above.
* Select the commands to be disabled/enabled.
* Initially, you must explicitly disable commands.  The first time the plugin
is installed, all commands are enabled.
* At least one command must be enabled.
