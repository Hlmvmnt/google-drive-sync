title: Experimental Features
---

There are a few new plugin features that explore the ancillary
functions of the Google Drive API, or were intended to be temporary
workarounds.  These include functionality the developers find
"interesting", but further practical use and development is likely needed.
As always your feedback is appreciated.

* [Designated Folder Options](#designated-folder-and-folder-colors)

### Limited Drive Access
This feature, given the current integration functionality and access
policies of Google Drive, falls into the category of "workarounds".  

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Limited Access](../assets/img/limited.png)
{: refdef}

The "**Use limited Drive access**" check box specifies how much access, with
your authority, the plugin requests from Google Drive.  If un-checked, the 
plugin requests unrestricted access to all files and folders (this is the
traditional access mode used by the old plugin).  If checked, the plugin
will request more restrictive access: only those files which are created,
or previously accessed by the plugin can be accessed in this mode.  

The initial motivation for the feature was to allow the plugin to 
continue to work with the old plugin's built-in, but "unverified", OAuth 2.0
app credentials. After Google changed policies with regard to unverified
app access, users generally were faced with using this access mode, or 
obtaining and using [personal OAuth 2.0 credentials](oauth). There are
many reports of success with both alternatives. 

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    This project aims to submit a revised plugin to Google for
verification.  Therefore the limited access feature might be
a candidate for deprecation in a future release.  Still, some may
consider this a security feature, to prevent any
chance for the plugin to access sensitive files.  Please share your 
experiences so we can all better understand the utility of the feature
going forward.
</div>

Please note that beyond the "workaround", this feature may only provide
false security and incompatiblity, for at least two reasons.

First, the limited or restricted access mode may not integrate well
with other KeePass compatible software that use Drive-hosted sync files,
in particular, Android and other mobile apps).  For example, if you
originally create a Drive-resident database file with an Android-based
KeePass app, you probably won't be able to use the plugin to sync with
that file without explicitly granting access through Drive's web
interface.

Second, the plugin's behavior is quite benevolent, and its use of
your account is well documented here and in the code.  Only files and
folders that you direct it to are accessed, simply by the name of the
database file, and if given, a [folder it resides in](#designated-folder),
and *nothing more*.

### Designated Folder and Folder Colors
This feature allows you to specify a particular top-level folder to
contain the Drive files synchronized by the plugin, providing a
degree of tidiness in Drive archives.  The plugin
will only synchronize the current database with files contained in
this Drive folder.  The setting is found in the **Sync Authorization**
tab of the Configuration window.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Sync Folder set to "KeePass Sync"](../assets/img/sync-folder.png)
{: refdef}

If no folder is specified, the plugin reverts to the traditional
behavior of using the Drive "root" to access files.  You may also set a 
"default" folder name, to be used by new database sync configurations,
in the **Options and Defaults** tab, shown below.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Sync Folder default options and color"](../assets/img/sync-folder-defaults.png)
{: refdef}

The Drive API also allows clients to create folders with one of 
several colors, as viewed in the Drive web interface.  The
plugin offers this option as well.  On the "**Options and Defaults**"
tab, you can specify the color of your choice for *new*  folders created
by the plugin.  Existing folder colors can only be directly changed in
the web interface.  To select from the available colors, you must first
open a KeePass database that has been configured and authorized to
synchronize.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    To view all available Drive folder colors, you must first
open a KeePass database that has been configured and authorized to
synchronize.  Then click the <b>Get All Google Folder Colors</b>
button.
