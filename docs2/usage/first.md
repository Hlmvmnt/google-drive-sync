The plugin manages authorizing access to Drive and prompting
for your Google credentials if necessary.  Google associates your authorization
with the plugin, and that authorization is saved in the KeePass database.
Generally, you only log in once to authorize a database for all future
plugin commands.

Please check out the first-time walkthrough if you have never used the plugin before.
