To get aquainted with the plugin's settings system, the (new) authorization
flow, and synchronizing your first database, please review the
[walkthrough](syncing-your-first-database).
Users already familiar with KeePass Google Sync Plugin 3.0 should also find
this information useful.

The **Configuration** window customizes the plugin's
authorization and other settings for the current database, and sets
default configurations for all new databases that will be used with the
plugin.

For those who want to understand how the plugin works [internally](#internal-details),
there is also a brief introduction.
